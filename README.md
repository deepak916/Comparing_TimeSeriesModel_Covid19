# Comparing_TimeSeriesModel_Covid19

In this code we create and train the following models: SARIMAX from statsmodels, Prophet from Facebook, neural networks from Keras and XGBOOST. 
We will perform predictions using the trained models, and compare the accuracy of predictions statistically and visually.
